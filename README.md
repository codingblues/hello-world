Hello fellow humans,
My name is Alexander Pederson and I'm a budding programmer. I am just wanting to learn 
various technologies to help me organize my programming and showcase it. I'll likely
end up trying a few more to see what works best. Feel free to contact me through here.
I'll update with actual contact information in a bit.
